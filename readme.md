This is a simple project that will utilize the following technologies:
- Ollama
- Llama3
- nomic-embed-text
- langchain
- chromadb

This is to learn how RAG operates in a simple application.

I have a large corpus of data based on the UEFA champions league that I 
aim to store those embeddings within chromadb.

I'll likely need to leave it running for a period of time considering the 
dataset is very large and will have to make the data persistent.

That's what you may find the directory UEFA EURO 2020 in the .gitignore
